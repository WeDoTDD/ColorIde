# ColorIde

### Since I miss this plugin, I'm thinking about reviving it

# Overview
For some odd reason JetBrains hasn't implemented this natively.  That is, whenever you specify a color scheme in their IDEs, the project pane's background always stays this crappy grey color.  It's a much nicer experience when all window panes within JetBrains share the same background color which is what this old plugin used to do for people who wanted that.

This is a fork of the old project which was depreciated (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7055-color-ide).
